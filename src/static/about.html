        <h1>About</h1>

        <h3><a href="#what-is-this-site-anyway">What is Hi-Audio Music Platfrom?</a></h3>
        <p>Hi-Audio aims to create a <a href="https://blog.Hi-Audio.org/?s=numbers">huge collaborative database</a> of
            audio snippets, samples, recordings, and all sorts of bleeps, ... released under Creative Commons licenses
            that allow their reuse. Hi-Audio provides new and interesting ways of accessing these samples, allowing
            users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>browse the sounds in new ways using keywords, a "sounds-like" type of browsing and more</li>
            <li>upload and download sounds to and from the database, under the same Creative Commons license</li>
            <li>interact with fellow sound-artists!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also aim to create an open database of sounds that can also be used for scientific research and be
            integrated in third party applications. Using the Hi-Audio API researchers and developers can access
            Hi-Audio content a retrieve meaningful sound information such as metadata, analysis files and the sounds
            themselves. See the <a href="/help/developers">developers</a> section and the <a href="/docs/api">API
                documentation</a> for more information. Hi-Audio API usage is free for non-commercial use, but it can
            also be licensed for being used in commercial applications.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="#who-is-behind-this-site">Who is behind this site?</a></h3>
        <p>Hi-Audio was started in 2005 in the <a href="https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/">ADASP</a> of <a
                href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/">Télécom Paris</a>, Paris, France. Currently it is being
            maintained and developed by the Hi-Audio team, which is composed of current and former researchers and
            students of the research group.
            Hi-Audio is possible thanks to the support of Télécom Paris, who provides the needed hardware
            infrastructure to handle the site, and to the contributions of the Hi-Audio users. Check our <a
                href="https://blog.Hi-Audio.org/?s=sustainability">sustainability reports</a> for more information
            about how Hi-Audio is maintained.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, Hi-Audio would not be possible without the help of the great team of sound moderators, members
            of the Hi-Audio community themselves, who do this task voluntarily.</p>
