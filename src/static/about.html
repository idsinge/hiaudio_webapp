        <h3><a href="#what-is-this-site-anyway">What is Hi-Audio Music Platform?</a></h3>
        <p>Hi-Audio Music Platform aims to create a huge collaborative database of
            music snippets, samples, recordings, and all sorts of compositions released under Creative Commons licenses
            that allow their reuse. Hi-Audio Music Platform provides new and interesting ways of accessing these samples, allowing
            users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>browse a large music catalogue for research</li>
            <li>upload and download music clips to and from the database, under the same Creative Commons license</li>
            <li>interact and collaborate with fellow musicians and creators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We provide an online tool for musicians, researchers and an open community of enthusiasts of audio and music with a view to collect music recordings from a wide variety of styles and different cultures. We also aim to create an open database of music corpora that can be used for scientific research and be
            integrated in third party applications. Using the Hi-Audio Music Platform API researchers and developers can easily 
            access content a retrieve meaningful music information such as metadata, analysis files and the audio tracks
            themselves. See the <a href="/help/developers">developers</a> section and the <a href="/docs/api">API
                documentation</a> for more information. Hi-Audio Music Platform API usage is free for non-commercial use, but it can
            also be licensed for being used in commercial applications.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="#who-is-behind-this-site">Who is behind this site?</a></h3>
