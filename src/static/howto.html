                    <p>A Collection can contain other Collections or just a bunch of Compositions. There are two options for creating a new Collection:
                    </p>
                    <p>1) Using the shortcut. The first time you arrived at the landing page, if there are no Compositions yet, a blue-green button will offer the opportunity to create "New Music".</p> 
                    <p>2) Header menu option. A button with the text "Create New" is displayed at the top of the app to pop-up the form for filling the Collection info. This is equivalent to the shorcut option.  </p>
                    <p>Note that in the form is required to select the option "Collection" from the selectable list. After filling the form and saving it a green dialog confirmation should be displayed.</p>
                    <p>You can access to your list of Collections from the option called "My Collections" at the header menu. From there you can modify a Collection name or completely remove it, including its content (be careful).</p>

                    <p>In a similar way to how you create a Collection, you can create a Composition too, 1) by using the shorcut at the landing page, or 2) from the header menu option. See previous section. Instead of selecting "Collection" from the selectable list you need to choose "Composition".</p>
                    <p>Once you have successfully created your Composition, right after filling the form, you will be redirected to the Composition page, which has all the necessary functions to create and work with the music.</p>
                    <p>In the Composition page you have also antoher option at the top bar that allows you to edit or update the Composition details such as: description, privacy level, collaborators, etc. and you can also delete the Composition itself from this modal dialog.</p>

                    <p>Adding or uploading a new track it's possible from the Composition page. There is a file explorer button, right below the music controls, that opens the pop-up window that allows to choose one or several audio files. Currently, the allowed audio types are: .mp3, .wav, .m4a , .flac and .aac.</p>
                    <p>Depending on grant access to the Composition a Track attached to it can be saved and synced with the database or just temporally hosted locally on your browser.</p>
                    <p>If you have admin access to the Composition, to delete a Track you need to click on the blue options-menu, placed at the left top corner of each Track and select the option "Delete". If you don't have the right access, it's possible to also delete a Track from the current view, but will be only temporary. It will appear again after refreshing the page.</p>

                    <p>Recording a new Track from the microphone or the audio input source it's possible by clicking on the mic icon at the music controls. It will directly create a new track and start recording. It's important to allow the browser access to the microphone, this option will be prompted inmediately after visiting the Composition page.</p>
                    <p>Before recording a new Track is recommended to do the latency estimation, for that the mic needs to be accesible for the browser and you need to place the output of your audio system very close to the input so the signal that is emitted can be easily recorded.</p>
                    <p>Be aware when running the latency test that a noise will be played so keep the volume as low as possible but high enough to be recorded.</p>
